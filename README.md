## Instruction Notes
### Signing configuration
App is signed with a custom signing configuration based on the settings in the app level 
`build.gradle` file. Signing keys can be found in `/udakeystore.jks` file.

### Test data
The App starts with 2 initial Products saved into the database that will be updated within 1 minute
when the system recognizes them as outdated. Considering the "single source of truth" pattern
data is always shown from the database and regularly updated through the network. This feature
can be disabled via commenting out the `MyDatabase.insertInitialData()` method.
